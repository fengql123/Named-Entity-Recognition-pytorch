## Pytorch Models Built for NER Tasks
I wanted to deploy these models as I have achieved good test accuracy. However, I want to build a better model and achieve good test score on larger dataset hence I ended up not deploying it.

### Dataset Used
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/namanj27/ner-dataset

### Type of models
1) Bidirectional LSTM
2) Transformer Encoder
